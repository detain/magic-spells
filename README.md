*Magic Spells* is a game to practice _Spelling Words_ using _Speech Recognition_


## Why
I wrote this for my daughter to use for the following reasons
* wanting to help her
* wanting to up my family rep
* wanting to do less and be lazy about helping with homework
* boredom
* to stroke my ego
* couldnt think of any good 'original' idea for a simple game to make so i somehow wound up at this.
